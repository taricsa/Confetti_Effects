// https://github.com/taricsa/Confetti_Effects

/// The Confetti_Effects package provides components for easily adding
/// confetti particle effects to SwiftUI applications on macOS 14.0+.
///
/// Use the `ConfettiCanvasView` as a ready-made component that includes
/// a "Launch Confetti" button, or create your own custom implementation
/// using the `ParticleSystem` class directly.
///
/// Key components:
/// - `ConfettiCanvasView`: Ready-to-use confetti animation view
/// - `ParticleSystem`: Manages confetti particles and their physics
/// - `Particle`: Individual confetti particle with properties
/// - `ConfettiShape`: Enumeration of available confetti shapes
